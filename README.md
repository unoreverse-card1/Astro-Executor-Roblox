# What is Krnl?

# Krnl is one of the most reliable Roblox executors accessible in terms of script performance. Krnl is a very stable and dependable executor that rarely crashes. The trustworthy Ice Bear, who has already invented several legitimate cheats, also generated this Krnl. The whole graphics library, as well as the debug library, are supported by Krnl. Krnl can also support and run several exceptionally advanced capabilities, such as super-compact scripts like Owl Hub. These previously premium-only features are now available for ‘FREE’ on Krnl, therefore some scripts will no longer require a paid executor.
